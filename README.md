[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/maropu/spark-tpcds-datagen.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/maropu/spark-tpcds-datagen)

This is the TPCDS data generator for Apache Spark, which is split off from [spark-sql-perf](https://github.com/databricks/spark-sql-perf)
and includes pre-built [tpcds-kit](https://github.com/davies/tpcds-kit) for Mac/Linux x86_64 platforms.
To check performance regression for TPCDS, the benchmark results (sf=5) and codegen metrics of the current Spark master
are daily tracked in the Google Spreadsheet ([performance charts](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V8xoKR9ElU-rOXMH84gb5BbLEw0XAPTJY8c8aZeIqus/edit?usp=sharing) and [metric charts](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MP4q9pVpXWt-cL75brdyQmaZ6uhLhTnLg2ZXv2VLnoQ/edit?usp=sharing)).
Also, the validation results of the TPCDS queries are stored in [reports/tests](./reports/tests).

## How to generate TPCDS data

First of all, you need to set up Spark:

    $ git clone https://github.com/apache/spark.git

    $ cd spark && ./build/mvn clean package -DskipTests

    $ export SPARK_HOME=`pwd`

Then, you can generate TPCDS test data in `/tmp/spark-tpcds-data`:

    $ ./bin/dsdgen --output-location /tmp/spark-tpcds-data

## How to run TPC-DS queries in Spark

You can run TPC-DS queries by using test data in `/tmp/spark-tpcds-data`:

    $ ./bin/spark-submit \
        --class org.apache.spark.sql.execution.benchmark.TPCDSQueryBenchmark \
        sql/core/target/spark-sql_<scala.version>-<spark.version>-tests.jar \
        --data-location /tmp/spark-tpcds-data

## Options for the generator

    $ ./bin/dsdgen --help
    Usage: spark-submit --class <this class> --conf key=value <spark tpcds datagen jar> [Options]
    Options:
      --output-location [STR]                Path to an output location
      --scale-factor [NUM]                   Scale factor (default: 1)
      --format [STR]                         Output format (default: parquet)
      --overwrite                            Whether it overwrites existing data (default: false)
      --partition-tables                     Whether it partitions output data (default: false)
      --use-double-for-decimal               Whether it prefers double types (default: false)
      --cluster-by-partition-columns         Whether it cluster output data by partition columns (default: false)
      --filter-out-null-partition-values     Whether it filters out NULL partitions (default: false)
      --table-filter [STR]                   Queries to filter, e.g., catalog_sales,store_sales
      --num-partitions [NUM]                 # of partitions (default: 100)

## Run specific TPC-DS quries only

To run a part of TPC-DS queries, you type:

    $ ./bin/run-tpcds-benchmark --data-location [TPC-DS test data] --query-filter "q2,q5"

## Other helper scripts for benchmarks

To quickly generate the TPC-DS test data and run the queries, you just type:

    $ ./bin/report-tpcds-benchmark [output file]

This script finally formats performance results and appends them into ./reports/tpcds-avg-results.csv.
Notice that, if SPARK_HOME defined, the script uses the Spark.
Otherwise, it automatically clones the latest master in the repository and uses it.
To check performance differences with pull requests, you could set a pull request ID in the repository as an option
and run the quries against it.

    $ ./bin/report-tpcds-benchmark [output file] [pull request ID (e.g., 12942)]

## TPC-DS benchmark results on multi-socket environments

Multi-socket environments (multi-sockets and multi-cores) become common gradually in the world and I thnk many users might use Spark there.
However, we have a general question here; how does the number of Workers in a machine node impact Spark performance?
Then, I used an AWS EC2 x1.32xlarge (128 vCPUs, 4 sockets, and 1952 GiB) instance and
quickly run the TPC-DS quries on [the master branch](https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/520d92a191c3148498087d751aeeddd683055622)
in two conditions: 1 worker (SPARK_WORKER_INSTANCES=1) and 4 workers (SPARK_WORKER_INSTANCES=4).
I used openjdk v1.8.0_131 and Spark configurations were as follows;

    $ cat $SPARK_HOME/conf/spark-defaults.conf
    spark.driver.memory                   4g
    spark.executor.memory                 450g # 1800g in case of SPARK_WORKER_INSTANCES=1
    spark.executor.extraJavaOptions       -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=200
    spark.sql.shuffle.partitions          384
    spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold  20971520 # 20MiB
    spark.sql.crossJoin.enabled           true
    spark.sql.parquet.compression.codec   snappy

Inspired by [the CWI paper](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2771937.2771948), 
I also used NUMA-aware settings when launching 4 workers; the workers were assigned in each socket.
A hardware detail of x1.32xlarge instances is as follows;

    $ numactl --hardware

      0:  10  20  20  20

      2:  20  20  10  20
      3:  20  20  20  10

Based on the NUMA configuration above, I launched 4 workers with a `numactl` command;

    $ export SPARK_WORKER_CORES=32
    $ export SPARK_WORKER_MEMORY=450g
    $ numactl -m 0 -C 0-15,64-79 ./sbin/start-slave.sh <master URL> &
    $ numactl -m 1 -C 16-31,80-95 ./sbin/start-slave.sh <master URL> &
    $ numactl -m 2 -C 32-47,96-111 ./sbin/start-slave.sh <master URL> &
    $ numactl -m 3 -C 48-63,112-127 ./sbin/start-slave.sh <master URL> &

I got TPC-DS query performance numbers on the 3 conditions above and computed relative performance indicators,
(`4 workers + numactl` / `1 worker`) numbers. I show you the best/worst 5 queries below;

![Best-5 numbers](reports/materials/best5.png)

![Worst-5 numbers](reports/materials/worst5.png)

The results a bit suprised me and the Q58 performance of `4 workers + numactl` was about 9x faster than `1 worker`.
As you can see the worst-5 numbers, we had no negative impact by the NUMA-aware settings.
Based on the investigation, I strongly recommend you to use `numactl` for launching multiple workers on a node with multi-sockets.

I wrote easy-to-use scripts (`start-slave-with-numactl.sh` and `stop-slave-with-numactl.sh`)
to control workers by taking into account NUMA configurations in your Spark cluster.
The script starts a single worker for each socket if `numactl` installed.
To launch workers with this script in your cluster, you just say:

    $ ./bin/copy-dir sbin                 // Copy the two scripts in your Spark cluster
    $ ./bin/start-slaves.sh

To stop workers launched by the script above, you say:

    $ ./bin/stop-slaves.sh
